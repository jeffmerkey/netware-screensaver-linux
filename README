NetWare SMP style worm screesnsaver for Linux using ncurses

USAGE:  netware-worms [cpus|speedup]
    i.e. worm cpus=<num=8 to 256> speedup=<divisor=1|2|3|4>
examples:
    netware-worms cpus=8;
       start worm screensaver with 8 worm threads
    netware-worms speedup=4
       run worm screensaver at 4X speed

This screensaver is built as both a dynamic shared object (*.so) and static
archive (*.a) library module which allows other user space programs and
consoles to invoke this screen saver as well as tmux, screen, and other
BASH type programs setups.

This screensaver uses ncurses and is text based which is identical
to the Novell Netware SMP multi processor screensaver which displayed
a color coded worm for each processor running.  As each processor load
increases on a particular processor, the longer the worm becomes and
the faster it moves across the screen corresponding to that particular
processor.  As the overall system load average across the system increases,
the base clock rate for all the worms increases slightly to indicate 
load average is increasing.


BUILD

You must have the ncurses-devel packages installed in order to make
ncurses apps on your system.  you can try "yum install ncurses*" to get 
all of the ncurses packages for RedHat and CentOS systems.  This version 
was developed on a Red Hat 7 / CentOS 7 system. 

to make, type:

# make -f Makefile <enter>

the build process should display:

g++ -g -c -O3  -fPIC -Wall libnetware-screensaver.c 
ar r libnetware-screensaver.a libnetware-screensaver.o  
ar: creating libnetware-screensaver.a
ld -shared -lc -o libnetware-screensaver.so libnetware-screensaver.o  
g++ -g -O3 netware-worms.c -Wall -o netware-worms -lncursesw -lpthread libnetware-screensaver.a

to perform a clean build:

# make -f Makefile clean <enter>

should display:

rm -rf *.o libnetware-screensaver.a libnetware-screensaver.so netware-worms


INSTALLING/UNINSTALLING

To install:

# make -f Makefile install <enter>

should display:

install -m 0755 netware-worms /usr/bin
install -m 644 libnetware-screensaver.so /usr/lib
install -m 644 libnetware-screensaver.a /usr/lib
install -m 644 netware-worms.h /usr/include
ldconfig
ldconfig

To uninstall:

# make -f Makefile uninstall <enter>

should display:

rm -vf /usr/bin/netware-worms
removed ‘/usr/bin/netware-worms’
rm -vf /usr/lib/libnetware-screensaver.so
removed ‘/usr/lib/libnetware-screensaver.so’
rm -vf /usr/lib/libnetware-screensaver.a
removed ‘/usr/lib/libnetware-screensaver.a’
rm -vf /usr/include/netware-worms.h
removed ‘/usr/include/netware-worms.h’
ldconfig
ldconfig

RUNNING

you can execute the program directly as:

# ./netware-worms <enter>

you can also add arguments to force number of cpus and a speedup divisor

# ./netware-worms cpus=8 speedup=4 <enter>

INSTALLING SCREENSAVER IN THE BASH SHELL

To install the screensaver as a bash program which auto activates, use the program called
"screen" coupled with Bash.  The "screen" program has support for adding and invoking
terminal based screensavers under Bash.

You can install the program on CentOS and RHEL with yum by
typing "yum install screen" if the program is not installed by default.  You will need
to create a .screenrc file in the user home directory (i.e. ~/.screenrc)
which contains the following commands:

Sample ~/.screenrc
------------------
blankerprg netware-worms
idle 60 blanker

Please note the idle command which specifies how many seconds to delay before invoking
the screensaver (in this example it is 60 seconds)

You also need to modify the ~/.bash_profile default bash configuation file to invoke
screen by default after login.  Add the following command to the ~/.bash_profile
config file:

Sample ~/.bash_profile
----------------------
# .bash_profile
# Get the aliases and functions
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
	. ~/.bashrc
fi
# User specific environment and startup programs
PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
export PATH
/bin/screen  <------------ add this line to the default .bash_profile config file.

After you have configured these two files, logout and log back into the system for
whichever account you have enabled and the screensaver will auto-activate after 
60 seconds of idle time.  The only disadvantage to using this method to enable 
a terminal based screensaver is you will need to type the "exit" command twice 
in order to logout of the session. 


USING LIBRARIES

You can also call the screensaver as a library function "netware_screensaver(cpus, speedup)"
from another application with your own timer setup, just be sure to link to the
 "-lnetware-screensaver" .so library in your linker statements or link to the static
library "libnetware-screensaver.a"
